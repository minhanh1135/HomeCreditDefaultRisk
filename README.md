# MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR HOME CREDIT DEFAULT RISK

With a significant number of individuals seeking loans and the challenge for lenders to identify reliable borrowers, this project aims to explore the use of the Home Credit Default Risk dataset from Kaggle as a valuable resource. By analyzing this dataset, which contains detailed information on borrowersâ€™ credit histories, financial indicators, and loan repayment outcomes, the research will investigate the factors influencing creditworthiness and develop a robust customer scoring model. Furthermore, the research will provide empirical evidence by examining the demand for lending and quantifying the default rate within the Home Credit Default Risk dataset, demonstrating the necessity for accurate credit assessment methods.
